How can the self-actualized man return to regret, after defining regret as a system of cause and effect... how can the self-actualized man cope with blunder. The man so self-actualized with his head in the clouds, ever-moving forward without regret or remorse, happens across an irony. To promote a style of self that places emotional regard in second place, and then... A sudden realization, as sudden as actualization, that the tables turn and what a turn. The man experiences a past act of his own, as if from a third person view, except it is second-person and he is being acted upon. A method or mode of behavior that helped him cope so well in the past has finally come to bear upon his self. How ignorant the man has been of emotional pain, never having allowed it into his own life. The desire to appear strong manifest a brittle shell of delusion hiding his eyes from the tears in others hearts. What can this man do now to reconcile with himself? To gaze in his mind, over the field of memories, at the moments of pain caused. How to see this, feel this and affect a change internally? How to adjust a fallacious first principle? no excuses, no rationalization, no justification... The universe has deemed it necessary and the man must learn, or history is doomed to repeat.
